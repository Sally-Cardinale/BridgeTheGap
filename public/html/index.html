			<h1>About us</h1>
			<p class="lead">While the main goal of this endeavor is to assist homeless individuals and families we recognize
				that homelessness is more complicated than where someone slept last night. Many individuals are one late rent
				payment away from homelessness, one bill away from living with no heat, and one meal away from hunger. Our goal
				is to strengthen our communities by connecting those in need with the agencies in their area who have the
				resources to assist them.</p>

						<h2>Faces of Santa Ana</h2>

						<p class="lead">In July 2015, Brian and Vanessa Peterson moved to Santa Ana, California with a burning
							desire
							in their hearts to love their neighbors unconditionally and sacrificially. Night after night, Brian was on
							his living room sofa reading a book called, Love Does, and one evening he heard the screams from a man
							experiencing homelessness right outside his 4th floor apartment window. The agony on this man’s voice
							gripped his heart as he realized, “This very man is my neighbor, and I am called to love him.” Brian ran
							into the bedroom to share the good news with Vanessa and explained, “We have to at least find out his
							name.”
							Two days later, on the way home from work, Brian’s heart led him to find this man. He sat down next to him
							on the sidewalk and had the first conversation with one of his neighbors experiencing homelessness. In
							this
							conversation, Brian saw beauty in his pain along, with glimmers of hope in his eyes. Up until this point,
							Brian hadn't painted in 8 years. However, from the deepest place in his heart, he asked, “Would it be ok
							if
							I painted your portrait?” From this single moment, Faces of Santa Ana was born.
