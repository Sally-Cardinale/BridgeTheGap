# BridgeTheGap

Bridge the Gap is application which aims  to create connections for individuals directly 
affected by homelessness and those at risk. The motivation for the application's development
is to use technology to assist the most vulnerable in our communities.

When developing the design for this application, the user experience was very important. We
wanted to create a design that was easy to understand and could provide real-time data both 
to those in need as well as the agencies who serve them. Additionally, we wanted to be sure
to provide an avenue for community members who wanted to help but didn't know where to start.

When the user visits the application's <b>home page</b> they will see the following web page:

Following the home page the user will see a brief <b>About Us</b> section describing the goal
of this project.

The user will then find a <b>How it Works</b> section with four options to select depending on
who is visiting the page (i.e. individuals in need, agencies with resources, agencies needing resources,
community members/groups who want to help).

Once the user selects the page that meets their needs they will be routed to a page
containing a form requesting their information and once they click submit the data 
which most closely matches there request will be populated on the right side of the
screen.

Also located on the home page is a <b>Spotlight</b> section which will highlight an 
agency who works within the community and includes a donation button to allow visitors
to the site to donate to the spotlighted agency to encourage agency participation in the
site.

Lastly there is also space for testimonials and contact information at the bottom of the home page.

In creating this application the following technologies were used:
- MySQL/MySQL Workbench,
- Node, 
- Express, 
- Trello, 
- Sketch,
- Google Hangouts, 
- Heroku, and
- Adobe Creative Suites.

This application was deployed using Heroku and the dotenv npm package was used to protect
sensitive information. 

This project is useful because it bridges a gap between those in need who are often unable
to obtain the services they need due to outdated information. Agencies who choose to participate
in our application will be inputting their data in real-time which will decrease or eliminate an
already frustrated population with coming face-to-face with dead-ends and more quickly connecting 
them with the services they need.
